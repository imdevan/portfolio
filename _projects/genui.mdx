  # Working at GenUI
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    Working at GenUI was a really great transition into fulltime after freelancing for 4 years. 
    I joined the company on a team that was collaborating with microsoft research. 
    I came onto the project as a contributing developer, I soon took over as the 
    technical lead on the project when the current lead left the company. 
    I would go on to lead 3 major project teams as well contribute to other projects.

  <FIP>
    When I started at GenUI in 2021 the COVID pandemic was in it last major leg, 
    but vaccines were not yet rolled out nationally. 
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    The first project I completed for GenUI was a data storage system that stored
    data used by a chatbot created by the Microsoft Research team to help people 
    determine if they were eligible for the vaccine based on geological and personal
    health factors. 
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    Once vaccines rolled out nationally and the first project wrapped, my team transitioned 
    to building a tool that would allow non-profit organizations to cross collaborate 
    in order to facilitate vaccine distribution to impoverished and individuals
    that would otherwise have difficulty accessing the vaccine.

    ## 
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    The Native BioData Consortium (NBDC) is the first 501(c)(3) nonprofit 
    research institute led by Indigenous scientists and tribal members in the 
    United States. As a biorepository (or “biobank”), they ensure that advances 
    in genetics and health research benefit all Indigenous people.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I led the technical team to build the first version 1 of the Native BioData's
    BioBank. My team used <To a="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</To> and Prisma to quickly build and deploy a 
    full-stack Node+Typescript driven application that was hosted on premises 
    on sovereign Native American land. 
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    ## Cross Team Collaboration
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    In addition to being a team lead, I also contributed on several projects in varying capacities 
    from Csharp to Elixir
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    ## Internal Tooling
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    One of the projects I'm most proud of at GenUI was developing a react+nextjs toolkit that could be used to quickly
    jumpstart Next.js projects. Which was used by 3 different large scale projects while I was at GenUI.
