    Azure Dev Ops kind of sucks, I thought it would be fun to build a tool that makes it a little better. 
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    The goal is to build a tool that will replace 80% of daily interactions that a 
    typical developer would perform in Azure DevOps using the Azure DevOps API 
    and storing 0 (Zero) ADO user information. 
  </FIP>

    The secondary goal of this project is to deploy to android, ios and web. Starting with a web roll out built 
    with <To a="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</To> via <To a="https://expo.dev/">Expo</To>. It's also an
    excuse for me to get silly with fun <To a="https://motion.dev/">Motion</To> animations.
