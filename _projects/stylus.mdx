    I recently discovered an open source chrome extension called <To a="https://chromewebstore.google.com/">Stylus</To>.
    The project enables a user to write custom css for any webpage. Which sounds shady, but it is open source adn the code is out on display.

    One of the things I love about the web is the hackability (read: adatability) of websites.
    In a way that users of the thing can remix and in a sense re-imagine the design of it.

    A recent fixation of mine has been to zhush up websites that I frequent.

    In the last couple of mounts I've created 15 different styles for different websites and have had over 1,400 users download my
    site edits.
