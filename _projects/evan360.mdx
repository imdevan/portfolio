  # The Platform
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    Each company that subscbribes to the Evan360 platform is registered a
    subdomain that isolates all of the user's data from other companies.
    Companies can have teams that allow for managers to signup their team
    members.

  # Built for Everywhere
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    From the beginning our clients wanted the project to ship everywhere. And
    why wouldn't they? And so we delievered. By building the frontend of the
    platform in React we were able to build a static single-page application
    that could run, quickly, on the web IOS and Android. From connecting to
    support in real time, to managing the backend of the app. Everything thing
    was built around the mobile web. The app runs great on mobile phone
    browsers, as an app, or on the desktop.

  # Built for Customization
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    Due to tightly coupling the frontend of the app with the infrastructure it
    was easy to add features that enabled multiple users of the app to feel
    connected under one experience. Allowing teams and companies to customize
    their pages also allowed Evan to blend more seamlessly with the tools that
    employees are used to using.

  # Built for Simplicity
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    We wanted to make getting help as easy as possible and as simple as possible
    to prevent causing more problems from our users who are already coming to
    the platform after being being unable to solve a problem they already had.
