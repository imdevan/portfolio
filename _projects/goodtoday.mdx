    <To a="http://goodtoday.org">Good Today</To> is a non-profit organization that enables individuals and organizations to
    subscribe to doing good. Each day their users receive an email with two different charities.
    By selecting one of the charities the user will automatically donate an amount ranging 25 cents to 1 dollar, 
    otherwise the user will donate to either of the charities selected randomly.

      I was brought on to this project to translate design into a pixel perfect responsive website. And built a 
      portal for users to sign up for the service which connected to stripe as well as their in house CRM.

    Good Today was a collaboration with <To a="http://studiongd.com">Nick Dunlap at Studio ngd</To>. Nick, who was
    really awesome to work with, provided the UI, UX, and copy design. What I loved about working with Nick was 
    his attention to detail and getting things right, while maintaining a positive "chill vibes" disposition.

    This project was a lot fun to work on because there were a lot of cool bespoke animations. Although the version of
    the website that I created has since been succeeded by a more static design the website that I developed
    had parrallax scrolling in background transition sections of the page and many foreground elements that scrolled
    at varied velocities to create the illusion of depth in order to engage potential donators.

    Due to a large amount of mobile traffic expected it was important that the mobile website 
    functioned and looked just as good as it's desktop counterpart.
