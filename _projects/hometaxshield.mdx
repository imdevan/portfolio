    # Background
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    Home Tax Shield ensures homeowners don't pay more than necessary 
    on property taxes by harnessing advanced technology and expert advocacy. 
    The firm streamlines the tax protest process with a simple online sign-up

    The commitment to transparency and effective service underpins their approach 
    to achieving fair property tax evaluations for homeowners.

    # Dashboard Development
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
     I developed an intuitive web portal using Retool that empowered the support team to efficiently manage over 12,000 property tax appeals and oversee more than $7 million in assets. This development significantly enhanced the administrative workflow, enabling the team to handle complex data with greater ease and accuracy.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    ## Bulk Updates
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    To further improve the system's capabilities, I integrated a feature that allowed users to perform bulk edits on property records. This functionality was crucial in enabling large-scale modifications, which saved time and reduced the potential for manual errors, thereby boosting productivity.

    ## Web Sockets
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    Additionally, I implemented web sockets to synchronize data across user sessions in real time. This  ensured that all users had access to the most current data, facilitating better collaboration and decision-making across the platform.
