    When I was brought on to this project the team had a tight deadline and unfinsihed designs. By thinking in systems I was able to take the incomplete designs and built a component system, so that when new designs came I could use the components that fit into the designs we did have. When I needed to create a new component to fill in a gap in design, I would build with the mindset that piece could be used again to make future pages easier to developer.
