    # Background
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
  <To a="https://getbiofuel.com/">GetBiofuel</To> advocates for the use of biofuels 
  like ethanol to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 46%, supporting U.S. 
  energy independence with over 97% of biofuel produced domestically. They promote environmental
   preservation through innovative jobs and cleaner air, 
   aiming to integrate biofuels more broadly across America.

    When I was brought on to this project the team had a tight deadline and 
    unfinsihed designs. By thinking in systems I was able to take the incomplete 
    designs and build a component system, so that when new designs came I could 
    use the components that fit into the designs we did have. When I needed to 
    create a new component to fill in a gap in design, I would build with the mindset 
    that piece could be used again to make future pages easier to developer.

    # BioFuel Finder
  </FIP>
  
  <FIP>
    One critical aspect of this project was integrating with the google maps api to showcase nearby 
    biofuel locations. The tool could be used on one of two ways, either finding biofuel nearby a current location,
    or to see biofuel locations that were along a persons route.

    ## BioFuel FInder
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    The idea behind the fuel finder was to showcase local gas stations that sold
    Unleaded 88 and Flex Fuel. The following is an example of someone searching for 
    BioFuel in the San Francisco Area

    ## Trip Planning
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    Probably the most complex integration between between Google Maps and my clients services. That also required custom 
    elements for each map interaction. From the trip inputs to the marker information.
  </FIP>

  <FIP>
    The following example shows a user traveling from San Francisco to Seattle searching for BioFuel along their route.
