    # The Problem with AI Editors
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I was spending hours crafting the perfect prompts for AI coding assistants. Copy-pasting context. Manually gathering file contents. Repeating myself across different tools.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    There had to be a better way.

    # Building a Solution
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    Prompter CLI started as a simple script to pipe file contents into my clipboard. But as I used it more, I realized it could be so much more than that.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    What if I could template my most common prompts? What if I could automatically gather context from my entire project? What if I could make this work with any AI editor?

    Whether you're using Cursor, Windsurf, or any other agentic editor, Prompter CLI makes it easy to provide the right context every time.
