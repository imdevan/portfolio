    # Breathing new life into a community staple
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    This year I dove headfirst into React Native. After years of web-focused development, mobile felt like uncharted territory worth exploring.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    On the web, <To a="https://react-select.com/">React Select</To> is my go-to for dropdowns. It's flexible, accessible, and just works. Naturally, I went looking for something similar in the React Native ecosystem.
  </FIP>

    I found react-native-dropdown-picker. Despite some rough edges, it was the closest thing to React Select I could find. More importantly, it had traction: 80,000+ weekly downloads on npm, a healthy star count, and an active community of users.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    But something was off. Twelve pull requests sat open, some over a year old. The last meaningful update was two years ago. The project wasn't dead, but it was definitely on life support.

    ## Finding a starting point
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    While digging through the issues, I discovered another developer had already forked the project and addressed some of the outstanding problems. Rather than starting from scratch, I forked their fork and built from there.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    The internal examples directory was in rough shape. A single dropdown example that barely worked and gave no real insight into the component's capabilities. Not exactly ideal for testing changes.

    # Changes
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I rebuilt the examples directory from the ground up. Instead of a single dropdown, it now displays a comprehensive list of pickers from an array, each configured differently. Any change to the core library immediately shows its impact across every variation.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I configured the example app to point directly to the local project files. Now it serves as a real-time benchmark for the state of the codebase.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    From there, I worked through the backlog. Merged the open PRs that made sense. Fixed linting errors. Resolved TypeScript build failures. Got the test suite passing again.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I submitted a PR with all my changes and noticed an open issue looking for maintainers. Perfect timing.

    # Next steps
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    I'm working on getting my changes deployed this week. The immediate goal is a stable release with all the fixes and improvements merged.
  </FIP>
  <FIP>
    After that, I'm planning a larger overhaul of the UI rendering system. The current approach is too rigid. I want to give developers more control over how the picker looks and behaves without fighting the library's opinions.
  </FIP>

    This work is happening alongside my other side project, <To a="/side-projects/dance-partner">Dance Partner</To>. Both are pushing my React Native skills in different directions, and I'm here for it.
