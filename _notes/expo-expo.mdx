## Why I Started Expo Expo

Lately, I've been itching to dive into **React Native**. I’ve built plenty of web apps with **Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind**,
but I wanted to expand my skillset into deeper into mobile development. The problem? Most React Native starter templates aren’t **production-ready**. They give you the basics but leave you doing a ton of extra work just to get something deployable.

That’s where **Expo Expo** comes in.

## The Idea

I wanted a **React Native starter kit** that I could spin up and ship **to production in days, not weeks**. Something with **authentication, testing, theming, and deployment** all wired up from day one. And, more importantly, something that sets me up for success on another React Native side project I’ve been brainstorming.

### Inspired by

Expo Expo is heavily inspired by another project of mine, **<To a="https://github.com/imdevan/next-launch">Next Launch</To>** — a
jump starter for Next.js projects that I created while working at GenUI. The same philosophy applies here: get rid of
the boilerplate, wire up the essentials, and get straight to building.

I also drew inspiration from projects like <To a="https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate">Next.js Boilerplate</To> and
<To a="https://tamagui.dev/takeout">Tamagui Takeout</To>, which offer well-structured templates for fast development. However, each
have their own shortcomings. Even this one has shortcomings, I suspect if it turns out like Next Launch
the boilerplate produced will put off a lot of people that don't want to have think about things like localization and
form validation. But if I'm hoping to deploy something that I can trust will work well and be delightful to use by end users
quickly, I know I'm going to want those things.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

Here’s what Expo Expo already includes:

- ✅  Out-of-the-box up-to-date **Expo project**
- ✅  **Jest** + **Playwright** for testing
- ✅  **Localization** support
- ✅  **GitHub workflows** for CI/CD
- ✅  **Prettier + Linter** setup

And here’s what’s next:

- 🚧  **Clean UI components**
- 🚧  **Tailwind theme configuration**
- 🚧  **Basic settings page**
- 🚧  **Next.js wrapper for web deployments**
- 🚧  **Easy deploy to web, Android, and iOS**

## 🎯 The Goal


The primary goal of “Expo! Expo!” is to teach myself react-native (after all these years) while building something I
actually want to use for development.

I hope that the end result will be a boilerplate that I can use to repeatedly easily launch production quality,
cross platform, react-native apps.
