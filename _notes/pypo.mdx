## What is PyPo?

I took the Fast API template projct, and added Infinite Red's Expo starter project. Then I used the Open API typescript generater to generate the
client side code to fetch data from the api. Such that one can write the models used by the db in python, and can easily generate all of th typescript and
React Query requests to manage data on the client.

## Why is PyPo

I needed a good starting point for building an Expo project and I wanted to specifially branch out of the Javascript Ecosystem.

What I love about the Open API model is that it would be near trivial to move the backend to any other language as long as it is Open API compatible

Lately, I've been itching to dive into **React Native**. I’ve built plenty of web apps with **Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind**,
but I wanted to expand my skillset into deeper into mobile development. The problem? Most React Native starter templates aren’t **production-ready**. They give you the basics but leave you doing a ton of extra work just to get something deployable.
