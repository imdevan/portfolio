import To from "_c/to";

This summer I had a revival; in a sense.

In finding a set of configs that worked for me; my vim; I found I really did enjoy this crazy editor.

## Why spend the time on this?

1. So I don't hate the time I spend working into someone elses eco system.
2. Does there need to be more reason?
3. Long term gain of craft knowledge
4. Optization mindset
