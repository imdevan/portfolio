For a while, I’ve been considering the best place to store my personal notes. Should they live in a private Notion space? A GitHub repo? A personal journal? None of these ever felt quite right.

Now feels like the perfect time to start sharing my thoughts on code more openly. So, I’m soft-launching this blog section on my site as a space to document and share what I’m learning, building, and thinking about.

# Why Now?

- Writing publicly encourages me to articulate ideas more clearly.
- Sharing knowledge helps reinforce my own learning.
- A blog creates a referenceable archive of insights over time.
- It’s an opportunity to engage with other developers and exchange ideas.

# What to Expect

This blog will feature:

- Deep dives into technical concepts
- Lessons from building and shipping products
- Debugging war stories
- Thoughts on engineering best practices
- General musings on software development

I’m keeping things informal to start—this blog is as much for me as it is for anyone else who finds it useful. I’m excited to see where this journey leads!

Stay tuned for more. 🚀
