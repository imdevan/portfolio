AI is everywhere. It writes code, generates images, answers questions, and occasionally hallucinates about historical events. It's genuinely transformative tech. It's also expensive.

ChatGPT Plus runs $20/month. Claude Pro is another $20. GitHub Copilot wants $10. Cursor Pro is $20. Stack these subscriptions and you're looking at a car payment just to have AI autocomplete your variable names.

But here's the thing: you don't need to pay for all of them. The free tiers are surprisingly capable, and if you're strategic about which tools you use for what, you can build serious projects without spending a dime.

I've been tracking the free AI landscape obsessively. Here's what actually works.

# The Free AI Resource Table

| Resource | Model(s) | Best For | Limits | Multi-Account Friendly |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <To a="https://google.com">Google Search</To>     | Gemini 2.5 | Web-focused queries, quick answers | None | Yes |
| <To a="https://gemini.google.com">Gemini</To>     | Gemini 2.5 Pro | General knowledge, long context | Generous daily limits | Yes |
| <To a="https://claude.ai">Claude</To>     | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Writing, analysis, coding | ~30 messages/day | Harder |
| <To a="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</To>  | GPT-4o | General purpose, plugins | Limited GPT-4o access | Yes |
| <To a="https://t3.chat">T3 Chat</To>      | Multiple models | Model comparison, dev-focused | Generous | Yes |
| <To a="https://kiro.dev">Kiro</To>        | Claude | IDE-integrated coding | Free tier available | N/A |
| <To a="https://cursor.com">Cursor</To>    | Multiple | Code editing, completions | 2000 completions/month | Harder |
| <To a="https://opencode.ai/">OpenCode</To>     | Multiple | Terminal-based coding | API-dependent | N/A |
| <To a="https://lovable.dev">Lovable</To>  | Claude | Full-stack app generation | Limited free credits | Harder |
| <To a="https://bolt.new">Bolt</To>        | Multiple | Quick prototypes | Limited free tokens | Yes |
| <To a="https://v0.dev">v0</To>            | Unknown | UI component generation | Limited generations | Harder |
| <To a="https://aistudio.google.com">Google AI Studio</To> | Gemini models | API testing, prototyping | Generous | Yes |
| <To a="https://huggingface.co/spaces">HuggingFace Spaces</To> | Various open source | Specialized models | Varies by space | Yes |
| <To a="https://perplexity.ai">Perplexity</To> | Multiple | Research, citations | Limited Pro searches | Yes |

# My Strategy

I don't use one tool for everything. Each has strengths worth exploiting.

For quick coding questions and pair programming, Kiro and Cursor's free tiers handle most of my daily needs. When I hit limits, I switch to Claude for complex architectural discussions or debugging sessions that need longer context.

For research and fact-checking, Perplexity's citation-backed answers beat everything else. Google's Gemini handles general knowledge queries without breaking a sweat.

For rapid prototyping, Lovable and Bolt can scaffold entire applications from a prompt. The free tiers are limited, but often enough to validate an idea before committing real development time.

T3 Chat is my secret weapon for comparing model outputs side-by-side. When I'm not sure which model will handle a task best, I test there first.

# The Catch

Free tiers exist to convert you into paying customers. The limits are real, and they'll bite you at the worst times. That 30-message Claude limit hits different when you're in the middle of debugging a gnarly race condition.

The multi-account game works for some services, but it's tedious and arguably against ToS. I'm not recommending it. I'm just noting that some services make it easier than others.

And free models are often not the latest and greatest. You're usually getting last generation's flagship, not today's cutting edge. For most tasks, that's fine. For pushing boundaries, you might need to pay up.

# Low-Cost Options Worth Considering

If you need more than free but don't want to commit to full subscriptions, there are some solid middle-ground options.

<To a="https://t3.chat">T3 Chat</To> is my top choice for general-purpose work. You get access to multiple models, can compare outputs side-by-side, and the pricing is transparent and reasonable. It's perfect for when you need more than the free tier but don't want to lock into a single service.

For coding specifically, I've been using <To a="https://cursor.com">Cursor</To>, but I'm seriously considering switching to <To a="https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode">OpenCode</To>. Cursor's token limits can feel arbitrary, and you're paying for completions you might not need. OpenCode gives you finer-grained control over token usage—you're paying for what you actually consume, not hitting a wall mid-session. That level of control matters when you're trying to keep costs predictable.

The key is finding the tool that matches your usage pattern. If you're doing quick queries and comparisons, T3 wins. If you're doing sustained coding work and want to optimize token spend, OpenCode's transparency is hard to beat.

# When Free Isn't Enough

If you're building production AI features, prototyping only gets you so far. Eventually you need reliable API access, consistent performance, and the ability to scale without juggling browser tabs.

That's where having someone who's navigated this landscape becomes valuable. Someone who knows which models excel at what, how to architect AI-powered features that don't break the bank, and when to build versus when to buy.
