import To from "_c/to";

# Preprompt

Pretty simple, but i think there are somethings that all oneshots should have

that lovable is actually pretty good at but wont do unless you ask

```
design:

minimal modern design aesthetic. lots of whitespace. large subtle shadows.

font: [ google font choice ]
icons: use [ feather | lucide ] icons

take into account dark mode. default to the system and include a toggle to switch that enables the user to switch
color scheme and font options should be easy to change via variable

performance:

make sure to use animations methods that render at least 60fps and keep the scrolling smooth

```
